# Mewjector API v3

Mewjector v3.0 adds exported functions to version.dll that mods resolve at runtime.
Three services: hook chaining, type ID allocation, namespace collision detection.

All existing chainloader behavior is unchanged. The API is opt-in. Mods that don't
use it work exactly as before. Third-party mods doing their own inline patching are
unaffected (but if they overwrite a managed hook site, `MJ_VerifyHooks` will catch it).


## Resolving the API

Mewjector IS version.dll, so `GetModuleHandleA("version.dll")` always works:

```c
HMODULE hMJ = GetModuleHandleA("version.dll");
typedef int (__cdecl *fn_install)(UINT_PTR, int, void*, void**, int, const char*);
fn_install install = (fn_install)GetProcAddress(hMJ, "MJ_InstallHook");
```

Or use `mewjector.h` (single header, no import lib needed):

```c
#include "mewjector.h"
static MewjectorAPI mj;

// In init:
if (!MJ_Resolve(&mj)) return;  // not present or too old
mj.InstallHook(...);
```

`MJ_Resolve` returns 0 gracefully if version.dll is the real system DLL.


## Versioning

`MJ_GetVersion()` returns 3. The number increments when exports are added.
Existing signatures never change. `MJ_Resolve()` gates on
`MJ_GetVersion() >= MJ_API_VERSION`.

## Hook Chaining

`MJ_InstallHook` manages a per-RVA linked list of hooks sorted by priority.
The game entry is patched once. Additional hooks for the same RVA chain through
trampolines without touching the game code again.

```
Game -> chain[0].hookFn (lowest pri)
          -> chain[1].hookFn
               -> ...
                    -> chain[N].hookFn (highest pri)
                         -> original game function
```

Each trampoline has the original function's signature. Call it to pass through.
Don't call it to short-circuit. Modify args before calling to intercept.


### Internals

First hook on an RVA:
1. Stolen bytes copied into an original trampoline (`VirtualAlloc` RWX):
   stolen bytes + `FF 25 00 00 00 00 [return addr]`
2. Game entry overwritten with `FF 25 00 00 00 00 [target]` (14 bytes).
   Extra stolen bytes beyond 14 get NOPed. Target = first hook's fn.
3. Original bytes backed up for integrity checks.

Subsequent hooks on the same RVA:
1. New entry gets a 14-byte JMP stub trampoline (RWX).
2. Inserted into the sorted list.
3. `MJ_RebuildChain`: updates the game entry target to the new chain head
   (`VirtualProtect` round-trip), then wires each stub to the next hook
   (or original trampoline for the last). Stubs are RWX so no protect needed.


### MJ_InstallHook

```c
int __cdecl MJ_InstallHook(
    UINT_PTR    rva,            // target function RVA
    int         stolenBytes,    // bytes to steal, >= 14
    void*       hookFn,         // same signature as original
    void**      outTrampoline,  // receives call-next function pointer
    int         priority,       // lower = called first
    const char* owner           // your DLL name, for logs
);
```

Returns 1/0. Failure is logged.

`stolenBytes` must land on an instruction boundary. Caller ensures no RIP-relative
instructions in the stolen range (they get relocated to a different address in the
trampoline). First hook establishes the count; subsequent hooks for the same RVA
warn if they disagree but use the established value.

`outTrampoline` stays valid for process lifetime. Cast it to the original fn type.

Priority conventions:
- 0-9: framework-level (CSF status interception, etc.)
- 10-49: core mod hooks
- 50-99: secondary/dependent
- 100+: observers, logging

Mutex-protected. Concurrent calls are safe but serialized.

**Example:**

```c
typedef void* (__fastcall *fn_apply_status)(void*, const char*, int, void*);
static fn_apply_status g_orig;

static void* __fastcall Hook(void* rcx, const char* name, int stacks, void* src)
{
    if (should_block(name)) return NULL;
    return g_orig(rcx, name, stacks, src);
}

// In init:
void* tramp = NULL;
mj.InstallHook(0x47f6a0, 15, Hook, &tramp, 10, "MyMod");
g_orig = (fn_apply_status)tramp;
```


### MJ_QueryHook

```c
int __cdecl MJ_QueryHook(UINT_PTR rva);
```

Returns hook count at an RVA, or 0 if unmanaged.


---


## Type ID Allocation

### MJ_AllocTypeIdPair

```c
UINT_PTR __cdecl MJ_AllocTypeIdPair(const char* owner);
```

Returns a unique base index. You own `base` and `base + 1`.

Starts at `0x1000` (well above vanilla 0-0x318). Atomically increments by 2
(`InterlockedExchangeAdd`). Monotonic, no free. IDs persist for process lifetime.

```c
UINT_PTR t = mj.AllocTypeIdPair("CSF");
// t = 0x1000, t+1 = 0x1001. Next caller gets 0x1002/0x1003.
```


---


## Namespace Registry

### MJ_RegisterName

```c
int __cdecl MJ_RegisterName(const char* category, const char* name, const char* owner);
```

Returns 1 if registered, 0 on collision (already owned by someone else).
Same-owner re-registration is idempotent (returns 1). Collisions are logged
with both owners identified.

Categories are arbitrary strings. Current conventions:

| Category        | For                                |
|-----------------|------------------------------------|
| `"status"`      | Custom status names                |
| `"formula_var"` | Custom deval variables             |
| `"conditional"` | Conditional_ dispatch names        |
| `"x_is"`        | X_is enum bindings                 |

512 total registrations. Mutex-protected.

```c
if (!mj.RegisterName("status", "ModRegen", "CSF")) {
    mj.Log("CSF", "ModRegen name collision");
    return;
}
```


### MJ_LookupName

```c
const char* __cdecl MJ_LookupName(const char* category, const char* name);
```

Returns owner string or NULL. Returned pointer is internal storage, valid for
process lifetime, don't modify it.


---


## Utilities

### MJ_GetGameBase

```c
UINT_PTR __cdecl MJ_GetGameBase(void);
```

`GetModuleHandleA(NULL)` as `UINT_PTR`. Already resolved before any mod loads.


### MJ_Log

```c
void __cdecl MJ_Log(const char* owner, const char* fmt, ...);
```

Writes to `mod_logs/chainloader.log`:
```
[HH:MM:SS.mmm] [owner] your message
```
No-op if logging is disabled. Shares the chainloader's log mutex.


### MJ_VerifyHooks

```c
int __cdecl MJ_VerifyHooks(void);
```

Checks every managed site: entry still has `FF 25`, target matches chain head.
Returns corrupted count (0 = clean). Runs automatically after all mods load.
Call manually whenever.


### MJ_GetVersion

```c
int __cdecl MJ_GetVersion(void);
```

Returns 3.


---


## Lifecycle

```
DllMain (loader lock held)
  Base dir, log, mutexes, real version.dll, config
  Mod loading deferred

First version.dll proxy call
  LoadModsOnce():
    g_mjGameBase resolved, API is live
    Phase 1: [LoadOrder] DLLs (mods can call MJ_* in DllMain)
    Phase 2: ScanPath scan
    Phase 3: GameDir (if enabled)
    Phase 4: Mewtator manifest
    MJ_VerifyHooks() runs automatically
```

Mods load sequentially via `LoadLibraryA`. Each mod's DllMain can safely call
any MJ_* function; previous mods' hooks and registrations are already complete.


---


## Raw Patching

The API does not intercept or restrict `VirtualProtect` / `VirtualAlloc` /
direct byte writes. Mid-function patches, vtable writes, arbitrary memory
access all work exactly as before.

The only thing that will cause problems: manually patching the entry point of
an RVA that Mewjector also manages. That overwrites the `FF 25` and breaks
the chain. `MJ_VerifyHooks` detects this but can't prevent it.

`MJ_AllocTypeIdPair` and `MJ_RegisterName` are voluntary. Hardcoding IDs or
names bypasses collision detection but otherwise works fine.
